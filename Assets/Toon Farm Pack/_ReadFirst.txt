Thanks for purchasing TOON Farm Pack!
Glad to have you as a customer.

Two easy steps are required in order to ensure proper function of the pack.

	1. Please make sure you install the proper version in your Unity Project. At the moment,
only built-in (2019.4.40 and later) and URP (2021.3.0 and later) are supported. An installer for
URP for 2023.1.0 will be added soon.

	2. Depending on the Unity version, the Color Space might be set to "Gamma" by default.
Make sure you set it to "Linear", in order for the lighting to function properly.
You can find the Color Space setting in: "Edit > Project Settings > Player > Other Settings > Rendering"

	3. Enjoy!
